&lt;p&gt;When talking about microservices, a lot of Nodejs developers will say that Node is
a better platform than Java and other languages to build microservices. The arguments
are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nodejs is faster than Java.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nodejs development is more productive than Java.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These claims are proved to be false already as I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on both
platforms in banking industry for the last couple of years. I have been
building REST API frameworks on both Java and Nodejs and the following are
my observations on Nodejs in enterprise computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;production-hell&#34;&gt;Production hell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As workers are single-threaded, any uncaught exception will crash the worker
and all the in-flight transactions will be lost and you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is
the state of each in-flight request. This is the biggest problem faced and
I have worked with several core Nodejs developers trying to mitigate the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is to capture that in the server.js and then wait for in-flight
to complete as many as possible in a unknown state of the server and then
shutdown the server. Not ideal but it reduce the risk to certain level. Due to
this reason, Nodejs API platform is only recommended for readonly API in the
bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node server crashes under load (cpu 90% or up). We found this during out loaded
test with Winston logger enabled and the server always dead without any response
after a while. The reason is these callbacks don&amp;rsquo;t have enough cpu time to
complete and there are piling up in memory until you run out of memory, the server
won&amp;rsquo;t shutdown in this situation but simply won&amp;rsquo;t respond. The solution for
us is to monitor the cpu usage and starting more containers when it is in
heavy load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;callback-hell&#34;&gt;Callback Hell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is know issue for Javascript. Although promise helps a lot, it is still a
big issue with Node platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-maintenance&#34;&gt;Code Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nodejs is easy to get into and very fast to build small Hello World application;
however, building complex enterprise level application with thousands of line of
code is not possible. When I look at my own code wrote one year ago, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
reason about what that piece code does. I have to put some debug info and run it
to figure out how the code works. Callback Hell is one of the causes. For
enterprise applications, easy to understand and maintain is very important and I
feel sorry for the bank employees who are taking over my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;debugging&#34;&gt;Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javascript as a platform doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a good runtime debugging tool that you can inspect
variables during runtime easily. There are some tools but one of them works as
good as other languages. I use a customized logger built by my self and put a lot
of logging statement in order to debug my code and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so many js developers
just use console.log:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-transaction-support&#34;&gt;No Transaction Support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No transaction support on the platform makes it not enterprise ready. Let&amp;rsquo;s say
you are building a stock order API, once the server receives the request, it needs
to save the order in backend database and route the order to an exchange for execution.
what if the communication to Exchange is down? There is no way that the local
database update can be rollback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lack-of-connectivity-to-backend-system&#34;&gt;Lack of Connectivity to Backend System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above order API, the order has to be routed to an exchange through MQ Queue
but node didn&amp;rsquo;t support it 2 years ago. Also, a lot of existing backend
systems and databases are not supported even today. I have worked with Strongloop
and IBM teams for three months to make IBM DB2
drive(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ibmdb/node-ibm_db&#34;&gt;https://github.com/ibmdb/node-ibm_db&lt;/a&gt;) worked on production without
memory leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;insufficient-of-module-and-version-management&#34;&gt;Insufficient of Module and Version Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people praises npm and I agree that it is very good tool to manage modules.
However, only manage modules is no enough, it has to manage modules with versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Node developers will have this experience. You have an application running today
and tomorrow, you run npm install again and it stops working:) As one of the dependencies
got a new version and it is not backward compatible. Shrinkwrap helps a little bit but
it is very hard to update one or two immediate dependent modules as there is no way to
update sub dependencies. Another way is to check in node_modules into git and packaged it
into docker container. Now we always package node_modules into docker image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;public-module-quality&#34;&gt;Public Module Quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt there is a very active community for Nodejs and there are a lot of modules published
on public npm repository. I myself got several modules published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are so many modules are in bad shape as developers of these modules
often migrated from frontend without any enterprise level experience. Some of modules got
10 line of the code but will depending on 8 other modules. Write a small express application
in nodejs and take a look at how many modules in node_modules folder. Is you application
using them all? I guess less than 5 percent of the code in node_modules are in the
execution path and the rest of them are just wasting your hard drive space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TJ mentioned the same reason in his farewell article regarding to the quality of the node
modules. Javascript sets the bar very low and it attracts a lot of low level developers.
Remember Visual Basic was the most popular language on Microsoft platform?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stability-of-the-platform&#34;&gt;Stability of the Platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one back I worked last year, they are still using Nodejs 0.10.39 as that was the only
production ready version. Both Strongloop and Joyent told us to stay on that version and as
I understand, other customers are on the same version. We were told to upgrade to 0.12.x
once it was prouduction ready and then before that Nodejs and IO.js were merged and Nodejs 4
was out. Before Nodejs 4 was production ready, they&amp;rsquo;ve moved to Nodejs 5 and now on Nodejs 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are having big issue with Nodejs 0.10.39 as https module is not performing with API to
API calls and the issue was resolved in 0.12.x. So our recommendation for Nodejs API
framework added another condition upon only readonly API - The API must not call another
API in https. All APIs that calling another API with https must be implemented in Java
framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;talents-abandon-the-ship&#34;&gt;Talents abandon the ship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might know, TJ who is the developer of express - most popular nodejs framework left
Nodejs to GO. Here is his &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@tjholowaychuk/farewell-node-js-4ba9e7f3e52b#.5brqa9has&#34;&gt;farewell&lt;/a&gt;
There are other heavy weight Nodejs developers left and that might make you think what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;existing-customers-are-stuck-or-leaving&#34;&gt;Existing Customers are stuck or leaving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some early adopter of Nodejs and all of the are trapped with old version of Nodejs
and they are so afraid to upgrade to the new version as memory leak will be hard to
resolve - refer to my production hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other companies, just rewrite the application with other language. One example is
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@theflapjack103/the-way-of-the-gopher-6693db15ae1f#.jfcsl8hlg&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the bank I&amp;rsquo;ve worked, they wrote some APIs in Nodejs in 2014 but most of them were rewritten
in Java in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;memory-footprint-is-high-on-multiple-core-platform&#34;&gt;Memory Footprint is high on multiple core platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one work, it uses less memory than Java, but on a multi-core system, you have to start
workers per cpu core in order to utilize the resource to its full potential. These workers
are independent and there is no shared memory, they allocate heap independently. If you start
four or eight workers, it uses more memory than Java that have only one instance multi-threaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;much-slower-than-new-java-platforms&#34;&gt;Much slower than New Java platforms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for speed, it is faster than WebSphere/WebLogic/JBoss but not in the same level as other
new containerless Java frameworks and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example/tree/master/performance&#34;&gt;benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;
that have both popular Java microservices frameworks and Nodejs/Express. The above performance
result only focus on raw throughput and latency. While more code is added, Nodejs will be
getting slower and slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work on both Nodejs and Java so my opinion is not biased but to point out the facts on
Nodejs platform. I am not saying Java is better as I know there are a lot of issues with
Java. I just hope these points will help you in choosing your next application platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Web Server</title>
      <link>https://networknt.github.io/light-java/example/webserver/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2016 08:25:10 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://networknt.github.io/light-java/example/webserver/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Most documents and articles regarding to Light-Java are about REST API; however,
there are a lot user cases that combine the API and static site rendering together,
especially, single page applications built on top of React or Angular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;handler-provider&#34;&gt;Handler Provider&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we know, the Light-Java needs a plugin to inject application logic and for
API project that is based on OpenAPI specification, this is generated by the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/tools/swagger-codegen/&#34;&gt;swagger-codegen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generated Handler Provider maps each endpoint to a corresponding handler
generated. For API server that need to serve static content along with APIs,
we need to wrap this map with Resource handler to serve static content. On top
of resource handler, we need a predicates handler to rewrite request to index.html
which can loaded your single page application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example web server, I redirect to index.html if path is not in the
following list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/api&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above rules make sure that images and other asserts(css etc) can be loaded and
API endpoint will be started as /api/xxx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;web-server-configuration&#34;&gt;Web Server Configuration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most of the case, each APP or API built on top of Light-Java framework will
have a configuration file to control how it behaves during runtime. Here is the
content of webserver.json&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;base&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;/public&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;transferMinSize&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;100&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that base is defined as /public, we know the static content root will be
/public and all static content will be served from this folder or subfolders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;location-of-static-content&#34;&gt;Location of static content&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Light-Java applications are packaged as a jar so the static content must be
served from somewhere inside the jar file. Where is the location for the static
content that can be mapped to /public?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is src/main/resources/public. As static content is loaded from /public
and internally it is based on the classpath. As we all know that resources is
part of the classpath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;docker-container&#34;&gt;Docker Container&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above section describes how to serve static content from packaged jar file and it
is only suitable for development. When you deploy the app/api to official environment
with docker container, the /public must be externalized so that website can be updated
independently without repackage the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the Dockerfile in the example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM insideo/jre8
EXPOSE 8080
ADD /target/webserver-0.1.0.jar server.jar
ADD /src/main/resources/public /public
CMD [&amp;quot;/bin/sh&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;-c&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;java -Dlight-java-config-dir=/config -jar /server.jar&amp;quot;]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The static contant in src/main/resources/public is added to the /public in the contain
and this folder can be mapped to host directory with -v if you want to update the site
in host file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example is very useful in self contained microservices that has a very
simple UI built on top of React or Angular. It give you an interface to
interact with the services running on the same instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working with my clients to transform monolithic Java EE applications to
microservices architecture, one of the most frequently asked questions from
my clients is how do you integrate your newly built microservices with existing
Java EE applications. In other words, how to leverage existing application
stacks when exposing REST APIs with microservices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most organizations especially financial institutions, they have big Java
EE applications running on Weblogic/Websphere that they&amp;rsquo;ve invested efforts
for a decade or longer. You cannot image that they can rewrite everything and
switch to microservices overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working the following four different approaches over the list 5
years and I will give my recommendations based on my experience. Please be
aware that this is just a generic recommendation and it cannot be applied
to all use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;api-gateway&#34;&gt;API Gateway&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most commercial API gateways offer the XML to JSON and JSON to XML
transformation feature and this was good selling point to in early days. They
promised that you buy their product and the gateway will transform your
XML based web services to JSON based REST APIs. The problem with this
approach is performance, as all of them provide a generic transformer working
with external defined mapping logic. The transformation is CPU intensive and
with the overhead of gateway security and other layers, the throughput and
latency are not acceptable. Also, there are other issues with commercial
gateways as I documented at &lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/architecture/gateway/&#34;&gt;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/architecture/gateway/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;customized-transformation-in-api&#34;&gt;Customized Transformation in API&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some developers and architects realized that buying a gateway cannot resolve
the problem magically so they tried to build the transform logic into the API
itself. The transformation code is customized per API and it is much more
efficient that generic transformer in gateways. This provide a little bit
more flexibility and a little bit increased performance but it is not easy
to write the transform code as most web services have very complicated request
and response schemas. Performance wise, it is better than commercial gateway
solutions but still very bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;calling-service-layer-behind-soa-or-emb&#34;&gt;Calling service layer behind SOA or EMB&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most web services are built with multiple layers and chances are you have
a service layer behind your web service tier with Java native APIs. In this
case, we can bypass web services and calling the native Java API (most likely
session beans) from your REST APIs. This gives us a relative good performance
and leverage the most complicated services in the application tier. It is also
a low cost solution to bring REST API on top of your existing applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only drawback is that these app layers are deployed on Java EE platform
and they have limited throughput and very hard to be scaled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;calling-book-of-record-directly&#34;&gt;Calling Book of Record directly&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to fully realize the benefits of microservices architecture, the
existing monolithic application must be rewritten so that microservices can
talk to the book of record directly. And this can be done during a long period
of time to break up existing system to function areas and convert them one by
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As describe above, it is recommended to rewrite the existing monolithic app
but if resources are constrained, then build microservices by calling
existing services are acceptable. As microserivces can be individually deployed
and replaced, it is easy to convert them all to the final stage one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://networknt.github.io/light-java/architecture/monitoring/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2016 21:13:27 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://networknt.github.io/light-java/architecture/monitoring/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Monitoring used to be a somewhat passive thing. You used tools to monitor the
application process/logs and perhaps send an alert if something seemed wrong,&lt;br /&gt;
but mostly it was hands off. When we move to microservices architecture, things
are changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;user-experience-and-microservices-monitoring&#34;&gt;User Experience and Microservices Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Microservices which are released more often, you can try new features and
see how they impact user usage patterns. With this feedback, you can improve
your application. It is not uncommon to employ A/B testing and multi-variant
testing to try out new combinations of features. Monitoring is more than just
watching for failure. With big data, data science, and microservices,
monitoring microservices runtime stats is required to know your application
users. You want to know what your users like and dislike and react.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;debugging-and-microservices-monitoring&#34;&gt;Debugging and Microservices Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Runtime statistics and metrics are critical for distributed systems. Since
microservices architecture use a lot of remote calls. Monitoring microservices
metrics can include request per second, available memory, #threads, #connections,
failed authentication, expired tokens, etc. These parameters are important for
understanding and debugging your code. Working with distributed systems is hard.
Working with distributed systems without reactive monitoring is crazy. Reactive
monitoring allows you to react to failure conditions and ramp of services for
higher loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;circuit-breaker-and-microservices-monitoring&#34;&gt;Circuit Breaker and Microservices Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can employ the Circuit Breaker pattern to prevent a catastrophic cascade,
and reactive microservices monitoring can be the trigger. Downstream services
can be registered in a service discovery so that you can mark nodes as unhealthy
as well react by reroute in the case of outages. The reaction can be serving up
a deprecated version of the data or service, but the key is to avoid cascading
failure. You don&amp;rsquo;t want your services falling over like dominoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloud-orchestration-and-microservices-monitoring&#34;&gt;Cloud Orchestration and Microservices Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reactive microservices monitoring would enable you to detect heavy load, and
spin up new instances with the cloud orchestration platform of your choice
(EC2, CloudStack, OpenStack, Rackspace, boto, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;public-microservices-and-microservices-monitoring&#34;&gt;Public Microservices and Microservices Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microservices monitoring of runtime statistics can be used to rate limiting
a partners Application ID. You don&amp;rsquo;t want partners to consume all of your
well-tuned, high-performant microservices resources. It is okay to trust your
partners but use Microservices Monitoring to verify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitoring public microservices is your way to verify. Once you make microservices
publicly available or partner available, you have to monitor and rate limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new concept. If you have ever used a public REST API from Google for
example, you are well aware of rate limiting. A rate limit will do things like limit
the number of connections you’re allowed to make. It is common for rate limits to
limit the number of certain requests that a client id or partner id is allowed to
make in a given time period. This is protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying public or partner accessible microservices without this protection is
lunacy and a recipe for disaster, unless you like failing when someone decides to
hit your endpoints 10x more than you did the capacity planning for. Avoid long
nights and tears. Monitor microservices that you publish, and limit access to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reactive manifesto is a good tutor for the types of monitoring you will want
to do and states that your system should react to change instead of just fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;microservices-framework-and-microservices-monitoring&#34;&gt;Microservices Framework and Microservices Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light-Java a mircoservices framework that comes with a runtime metrics which can
be used for Microservices Monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can query /server/health endpoint to detect if the service is available and healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The framework collects metrics info and pushes it into influxdb and dashboard can be viewed from Grafana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rate limiting can be enabled at client_id level or ip address/user level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes monitors load of each pods and can start new instances on demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TraceabilityId and CorrelationId in logs that can be traced with tools like Logstash, GrayLog and Splunk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reactive-microservices-monitoring&#34;&gt;Reactive Microservices Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reactive Microservices Monitoring is an essential ingredient of microservices architecture.
You need it for debugging, knowing your users, working with partners, building reactive
systems that react to load and failures without cascading outages. Reactive Microservices
Monitoring can not be a hindsight decision. Build your microservices with microservices
monitoring in mind from the start. Make sure that the microservices lib that you use has
monitoring of runtime statistics built in from the start. Make sure that is a core part of
the microservices library. Code Hale Statistics allow you to gather metrics in
a standard way. Tools like Influxdb and Grafana, Kibana help you understand the
data, and build dashboards. Light Java, the Java Microservices Framework, includes a metrics
middleware which feeds into CodeHale Metrics. Light Java also proivdes a rate limiting
middleware to limit access per client_id or IP address/user. The container orchestration tool
like Kubernetes can also spin up new nodes/pods. With big data, data science,
and microservices, monitoring microservices runtime stats is required to know your application
users, know your partners, know what your system will do under load, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;microservice-logging&#34;&gt;Microservice Logging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every instance of the service will have a unique identifier which most commonly will be
the docker container name or the hostname if not deployed in docker container. The code
to retrieve docker container name and hostname is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with docker container name, traceabilityId and correlationId will be logged as
context info for each logging statement. And once log files are aggregated together in
ELK, users can trace a particular transaction based on the traceabilityId or correlationId.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As microservices might be deployed across multiple geo-regions, the timestamp logged must
be UTC time so that logs can be easily ordered in the ELK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;microservice-alerting&#34;&gt;Microservice Alerting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logstash has features to send out alert when certain error code is spotted in the log files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework has a component called status and it has all the errors defined in a JSON
file which can be externalized. All the error code will be in a format ERRXXXXX and
certain error code can be setup in the alert to send out email or communicate to support
team with other channels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For microservices architecture, it is very important to trace request from one service to
another in the entire call tree in order to have big picture if something happens or have
an audit log that is aggregated by database or Splunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the framework, we have two Ids to serve this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;x-traceability-id&#34;&gt;X-Traceability-Id&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generated by client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique for this client only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be database sequence number or UUID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be passed to the next service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be returned to the caller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will be logged in per request audit log&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;x-correlation-id&#34;&gt;X-Correlation-Id&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generated in the immediate service from client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be UUID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be passed to the next service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will be logged in per request audit log&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every service/API must check if this id available and generate one if doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in request header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;pass-ids-to-the-next-service-api&#34;&gt;Pass Ids to the next service/API&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to pass these ids to the next service, the call to the next service
must use Client module provided by the framework. It will put these ids to
the HttpRequest header with method calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hers is an example to set JWT tokens, traceabilityId and correlationId&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For microservices architecture, a request sent from client may pass through several services to the
backend respository/Book of Record and then response is returned in the reverse path. If there is an
error in the call tree, we need to identify where is the problem during runtime. Also, for some mission
critical applications, the entire call tree must be in the audit log to meet regulatory compliance
requirement. For example, Banking applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework has two tracing IDs built in and X-Traceability-Id is one of them that handled by this
Middleware component. Another one is X-Correlation-Id which is documented in [Traceability]().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;X-Traceability-Id is generated by the original client and might not be unique across the API domain. It
is unique for that particular client though. It is usually a sequence number generated from database
or a UUID. The usage of this id is to debug broken transactions as every service will have this id
logged once if the service is called and will return this id in response header to the caller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every API/Service is responsible to pass the X-Traceability-Id (from request header) to the next service
(set the request header by Client when calling another service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all client will supply traceability_id so this is an optional field in the request header. If it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, do nothing. If it does exist, the framework is responsible to pass it to the next API
in the chain or pass to the Book of Record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is recommended that X-Traceability-Id should be persisted in Backend Repository/Book of Record.
However, this might not be possible for some legacy application, i.e.
mainframe applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should only be logged once in the audit log once your API processing is done and successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration for this handler is very simple, just control if this handler is enabled or not.
It will only be pluged into the request/response chain if enabled is true in the traceability.json&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Traceability Handler&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;enabled&amp;quot;: true
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;calling-sequence&#34;&gt;Calling sequence&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This handler will be loaded after metric handler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;dependencies&#34;&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This handler set the response header from request header; however, to make it work across services, it
depends the following middleware or component to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SimpleAuditHandler to log the traceabilityId to the audit log file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client to pass the X-Traceability-Id to the next service through HttpRequest Header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the framework design, we have adopted the same principal of microservices architecture to break
down the entire framework into smaller pieces so that each can be customized and replaced if
necessary. The only difference is that all the modules in the framework are wired in request/response
chain for best performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four type of components that can be wired in at different stage of the server start up. The
following is the loading sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shutdown Hook Providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startup Hook Providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handler Provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middleware Handlers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;plugin-implementation&#34;&gt;Plugin implementation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many way to implement plugins and wire in different implementations of the same
interface. Spring is one of the popular ways. However, it will make our framework depending on
a version of spring framework and that can cause a lot of problems if the API handlers are
using different version of spring framework. Also, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to make the framework depending
on spring and force everyone to include it. In the end, we are using Java SPI
(Service Provider Interface). In your generated API project, you can find four files in
/src/main/resources/META-INF/services. These files contains plugins to be loaded/executed during
server startup and shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;shutdown-hook-providers&#34;&gt;Shutdown Hook Providers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shutdown hook providers are plugins that would be called during server shutdown in order to release
resources. For example, close database connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All shutdown hook providers will implement interface com.networknt.server.ShutdownHookProvider&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface ShutdownHookProvider {
    void onShutdown();
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onShutdown() in your implementation will be called before server shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;startup-hook-providers&#34;&gt;Startup Hook Providers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup hook providers are plugins that would be called during server startup in order to initialize
resources. For example, create database connection pool, load spring application context etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All startup hook providers will implement interface com.networknt.server.StartupHookProvider&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface StartupHookProvider {
    void onStartup();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onStartup() in your implementation will be called before server startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;handler-provider&#34;&gt;Handler Provider&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one handler provider that is needed to wire in API implementations. In most of the
cases, it would be an instance of io.undertow.server.RoutingHandler just like the generated &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example/tree/master/petstore&#34;&gt;petstore
project&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is not
limited and it can be several handlers chained together. One example is the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example/tree/master/webserver&#34;&gt;webserver example&lt;/a&gt; and it
has several handlers chained together to provide API routing as well as static website. The handler
provide code can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example/blob/master/webserver/src/main/java/com/networknt/webserver/handler/WebServerHandlerProvider.java&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have OpenAPI specification defined, this handler provider will be generated from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/networknt/swagger-codegen&#34;&gt;swagger-codegen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/networknt/light-java-example/blob/master/petstore/src/main/java/io/swagger/handler/PathHandlerProvider.java&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;
is a generated petstore handler provider that has the mapping for all endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handler provider implements interface com.networknt.server.HandlerProvider&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface HandlerProvider {
    HttpHandler getHandler();
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The getHandler() will return an HttpHandler or a chain of HttpHandlers wrapped together. This handler
will be called in the request/response chain right after all middleware handlers are called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;middleware-handlers&#34;&gt;Middleware Handlers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some &lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/middleware/&#34;&gt;builtin middleware components&lt;/a&gt;
in the framework to address common cross cutting concerns. There are implemented in a way we think
the best to meet most of business requirements. In other words, there are opinionated. For product
that built top of the framework, you can add/customize/replace existing middleware handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All middleware handlers need to implement interface com.networknt.handler.MiddlewareHandler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public interface MiddlewareHandler extends HttpHandler {

    HttpHandler getNext();

    MiddlewareHandler setNext(final HttpHandler next);

    boolean isEnabled();

    void register();

}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;boolean isEnabled()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every middleware handler has a corresponding config file which is the same name lower case
with .json extension. There must be flag to indicate if the handle will be wired in during
server startup. This gives user a chance to temporary disable a particular middleware handler
without changing the SPI configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;void register()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function will be called when the middleware is wired in the request/response chain. It registers
itself and configuration to server info component which can be accessed through a special endpoint
to get runtime information on middleware handlers and their configuration along with other system
info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MiddlewareHandler setNext(final HttpHandler next)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As middleware handler are chained together, so the existing handler must be put in the current
handler as next. When the current handler is completed, it will call the next handler if there is
no error. And eventually, the user provided handler will be called if all middleware handler are
completed without an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-sequence-of-middleware-handlers&#34;&gt;The sequence of middleware handlers.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dependencies between middleware handlers so the sequence to plug them in is very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For default plugins generated from &lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/tools/swagger-codegen/&#34;&gt;swagger-codegen&lt;/a&gt;,
please refer to &lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/server/&#34;&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;diagram&#34;&gt;Diagram&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/images/handler_chain.png&#34; alt=&#34;handler_chain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that audit, metrics and exception need to hooked in the response in order to handle exceptions
on both request and response phase, calculate response time and dump response info into the audit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are testing performance of your microservices, you might be interested in
monitoring your server memory usage. The memory footprint is very important as we
are talking about microservices - we might need to deploy hundreds or even thousands
of microservices to compose a big application. In today&amp;rsquo;s cloud environment, you can
create vms or containers based on cpu, memory and hard drive usage and usually memory
is the big constraint and more costly than cpu and hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;monitoring-memory-usage-for-java&#34;&gt;Monitoring Memory Usage for Java&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very hard to get the accurate memory usage for Java process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-mac&#34;&gt;On Mac&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mac, I usually start my performance test with [wrk]() and run it for 1 minute and
monitor the memory with Activity Monitor. The memory tab will give you a snapshot of
memory usage on each process. The number is not the real memory usage but the max
memory usage and you can see it only increases to certain point and stays there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-linux&#34;&gt;On Linux&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;on-windows&#34;&gt;On Windows&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not using Windows so I have limited experience on how to monitor Java memory usage
on this platform. However, the generic JDK tools should work as other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has better ideas, please let me know or send me a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every module in light-java has a configuration file that can be
externalized with default can be in the module itself or the API implementation
config folder. In order to give an overview of the server runtime, system
properties, specification as well as configurations for each enabled modules,
there is a special handler that can be included in your swagger specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;info.json&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Server info endpoint that can output environment and component along with configuration&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;enableServerInfo&amp;quot;: true
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other modules, server info handler is not plugin into the handler chain
during server start up. It should be part of the swagger specification and
route to this handler in the routing handler. If enableServerInfo is false,
then an error message will returned with ERR10013 - SERVER_INFO_DISABLED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;swagger&#34;&gt;Swagger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with other endpoints/paths defined in the swagger specification, an
extra endpoint should be added with special oauth2 scope for this handler.
It is recommended to use /basePath/server/info so that some automatic tool
or API portal server can access to it in a standard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extension&#34;&gt;Extension&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other contributed modules or API application specific modules, please
following the following guideline to register your module
in /basePath/server/info endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For handlers, it is registered when injecting into the handler chain during
server start up.
For other utilities, it should have a static block to register itself during
server start up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the example code to register module and its config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ModuleRegistry.registerModule(ValidatorHandler.class.getName(), Config.getInstance().getJsonMapConfigNoCache(ValidatorHandler.CONFIG_NAME), null);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mask-sensitive-data-in-config&#34;&gt;Mask sensitive data in config&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When module registers itself, it provide the configuration in JSON format for
the module. Some components have sensitive info in their configuration, for
example, db password, client secret etc. The third parameter in registerModule
is a list of keys in the configuration file that need to be masked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; masks = new ArrayList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;();
masks.add(&amp;quot;trustPass&amp;quot;);
masks.add(&amp;quot;keyPass&amp;quot;);
ModuleRegistry.registerModule(Client.class.getName(), Config.getInstance().getJsonMapConfigNoCache(CONFIG_NAME), masks);

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;output&#34;&gt;Output&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the output from undertow swagger-codegen petstore specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{

      <guid>https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;light-java is a Java API framework based on undertow http core that supports
swagger code generation and runtime request validation and security verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It contains the following components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/server/&#34;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; - a framework on top of undertow http core that support plugins to
performance different middleware handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/config/&#34;&gt;config&lt;/a&gt; - A module
that supports externalized configuration for standalone application and docker
container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/utility/&#34;&gt;utility&lt;/a&gt; - utility classes that are shared between modules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/client/&#34;&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; - wrapper of apache HttpClient and HttpAsyncClient. support automatically
cache and renew client credentials jwt token&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/info/&#34;&gt;info&lt;/a&gt; - a handler that
injects an endpoint /server/info that can out all plugged in component on the
server and configuration of each component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/mask/&#34;&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt; - used to mask sensitive info before logging to audit.log or server.log&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/status/&#34;&gt;status&lt;/a&gt; - used to model error http response and assist production monitoring
with unique error code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/networknt/swagger-codegen&#34;&gt;swagger-codegen&lt;/a&gt; - a code generator
that generates the routing handlers and running API application based on swagger specification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This module is responsible for managing life cycle of the embedded Undertow core http server. It starts the
server and initializes all middleware plugins along with route handler providers. It stops the server and
allow the resources to be released even someone click ctrl+c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;middleware&#34;&gt;Middleware&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middleware plugins are the key components in the framework as they perform the heavy lifting behind the
scene. These components address the cross cutting concerns for all API implementation so that API developers
can focus on their domain logic only. Each component will have a config file (same name but with .json ext)
to control if the component will be enabled and its behavior. The framework has provide a list of the
middleware plugins and experienced developers can add other plugins into the request/response chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add your own middleware plugins, update com.networknt.handler.MiddlewareHandler in
your API project folder src/main/resources/META-INF/services&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the default middleware configuration generated by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/networknt/swagger-codegen&#34;&gt;swagger-codegen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# This file is generated and should not be changed unless you want to plug in more handlers into the handler chain
# for cross cutting concerns. In most cases, you should replace some of the default handlers with your own implementation
# Please note: the sequence of these handlers are very important.

#Validator Validate request based on swagger specification (depending on Swagger and Body)
com.networknt.validator.ValidatorHandler
#Sanitizer Encode cross site scripting
com.networknt.sanitizer.SanitizerHandler
#SimpleAudit Log important info about the request into audit log
com.networknt.audit.AuditHandler
#Body Parse body based on content type in the header.
com.networknt.body.BodyHandler
#Security JWT token verification and scope verification (depending on SwaggerHandler)
com.networknt.security.JwtVerifyHandler
#Swagger Parsing swagger specification based on request uri and method.
com.networknt.swagger.SwaggerHandler
#Traceability check if X-Traceability-Id is in request header and put it into response header
com.networknt.traceability.TraceabilityHandler
#Metrics In order to calculate response time accurately, this needs to be the second.
com.networknt.metrics.MetricsHandler
#Exception Global exception handler that needs to be called first.
com.networknt.exception.ExceptionHandler

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;route-provider&#34;&gt;Route Provider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/networknt/swagger-codegen&#34;&gt;swagger-codegen&lt;/a&gt; generates all the handlers and corresponding
test cases based on OpenAPI specification. It also generate PathHandlerProvider to group these handlers
together. This class is loaded by the server via Java SPI. The config file
com.networknt.server.HandlerProvider can be found at /src/main/resources/META-INF/services&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;io.swagger.handler.PathHandlerProvider

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;server.json is the configuration file for this module. To make it simpler, it only ip and port are
configurable at the moment. Other server parameters are set for the best performance assuming clould
deployment. In the future, these parameters might be exposed in the server.json.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an exmaple of server.json&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;server config&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;ip&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0.0.0.0&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;port&amp;quot;: 8080
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>status</title>
      <link>https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/status/</link>

      <guid>https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/status/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the scenario that error happens on the server, a Status object is designed
to encapsulate standard http response 4xx and 5xx as well as application specific
error code ERRXXXXX (prefixed with ERR with another 5 digits) and error message.
Additionally, an description of the error will be available for more info about
the error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;data-elements&#34;&gt;Data Elements&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the four fields in the Status object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    int statusCode;
    String code;
    String message;
    String description;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;construct-the-object-from-status-json&#34;&gt;Construct the object from status.json&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;status.json is a configuration file that contains all the status error defined
for the application and it has the structure like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;ERR10000&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;statusCode&amp;quot;: 401,
    &amp;quot;code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ERR10000&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;message&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;INVALID_AUTH_TOKEN&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Incorrect signature or malformed token in authorization header&amp;quot;
  },
  &amp;quot;ERR10001&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;statusCode&amp;quot;: 401,
    &amp;quot;code&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;ERR10001&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;message&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Jwt token in authorization header expired&amp;quot;
  },
  .
  .
  .
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To construct the object from this config&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    static final String STATUS_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED = &amp;quot;ERR10008&amp;quot;;
    .
    .
    .
    Status status = new Status(STATUS_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED);

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To construct the object with arguments to have a description with context
information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   return new Status(&amp;quot;ERR11000&amp;quot;, queryParameter.getName(), swaggerOperation.getPathString().original());

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;convert-to-json-response&#34;&gt;Convert to JSON response.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several way to serialize the object to JSON in response. And string
concat is almost 10 times faster than Jackson ObjectMapper. For one million
objects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Jackson Perf 503
ToString Perf 65

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;error-code-range-allocation&#34;&gt;Error code range allocation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error code prefixed with ERR with another 5 digits so that it can be easily
scanned in log files. Also, certain error code can be used to trigger an alert
such as email or pager notification on system wide issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make sure there is no conflict for error code allocation between
teams, here is the rule&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10000-19999 reserved for the framework/system.
   * 10000-10100 security&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;11000-11999 validation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12000-12999 undertow-oauth2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20000-29999 common error codes within your business domain.
90000-99999 customize error code that cannot be found in common range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;send-the-json-as-response&#34;&gt;Send the JSON as response&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Status status = new Status(STATUS_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED);
    exchange.setStatusCode(status.getStatusCode());
    exchange.getResponseSender().send(status.toString());

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This module contains some useful classes that shared by multiple modules within
the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;constants&#34;&gt;Constants&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contains all the constants shared by all modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;moduleregistry&#34;&gt;ModuleRegistry&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the plugin modules are loaded, it will register itself to this module along
with configuration. When /server/info is called, the endpoint will return all
plugged in modules and their configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;util&#34;&gt;Util&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some useful utility method like uuid generator etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://networknt.github.io/light-java/other/mask/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the entire life cycle of the exchange, there might a lot of logging statements
written to log files or other persistence storage. These logs will be used to
assist production issue identifying and resolving and a wide group of people might
have access to these logs. In order to reduce the risk of leak customer info,
sensitive info needs to masked before logging. For example, credit card number,
sin number etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given different API will have different sensitive data, the mask is configurable
and can be applied at header, cookie, query parameters and body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;mask-with-string&#34;&gt;Mask with String&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;mask-with-regex&#34;&gt;Mask with Regex&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;mask-with-jsonpath&#34;&gt;Mask with JsonPath&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A configuration module that supports externalized config in official standalone
deployment or docker container&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Externalized configuration from the application package is very important. It
allows us to deploy the same package
to DEV/SIT/UAT/PROD environment with different configuration packages without
reopening the delivery package. For
development, embedded configuration give us the flexibility to take default
values out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dockerizing our application, the external configuration can be mapped to a
volume which can be updated and
restarted the container to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, only file system configuration is supported but in a long run, this
module can be extended to support
configurations from database, http/https server and config API served by config
server. Given the risk of single
point failure, file system config is still the foundation. Only when the server
start, it will contact external
config sever to load (first time) or update local file system so that config
files are cached. Except first time
start the server, the server can use the local cache to start if config service
is not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;singleton&#34;&gt;Singleton&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one JVM, there should be only one instance of Config and it should be
shared by all the modules within the application. The class is designed as a
singleton class and has several abstract methods that should be implemented
in sub classes. A default File System based implementation is provided. Other
implementation will be provided in the future when it is needed.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;interface&#34;&gt;Interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following abstract methods are implemented in the default service provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Returns a HashMap by a config name (without .json)
public abstract Map&amp;lt;String, Object&amp;gt; getJsonMapConfig(String configName);

// Load config for server info so that the result can be masked with out impact the cached verison
public abstract Map&amp;lt;String, Object&amp;gt; getJsonMapConfigNoCache(String configName);

// Return a JsonNode by a config name (without .json)
public abstract JsonNode getJsonNodeConfig(String configName);

// Map the json to a POJO from a config name and class name
public abstract Object getJsonObjectConfig(String configName, Class clazz);

// Load config into a string by providing the full filename
public abstract String getStringFromFile(String filename);

// Load config into a InputStream by providing full filename
public abstract InputStream getInputStreamFromFile(String filename);

// A cached Jackson ObjectMapper that is shared to other modules
public abstract ObjectMapper getMapper();

// Clean up the config cache if there are any
public abstract void clear();

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage&#34;&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is encouraged to create a POJO for your config if the JSON structure is static.
However, some of the config file have repeatable elements, a map is the only
options to represent the data in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two methods return String and InputStream is for loading files such as text
file with different format and X509 certificates etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;getMapper() is a convenient way to get ObjectMapper instead of create one which
is too heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cache&#34;&gt;Cache&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loading configuration files from file system takes time so the config file will
be cached once it is loaded the first time. All subsequent access to the same
config file (maybe different key/value pair) will read from the cached copy.
In order to make sure that server start up won&amp;rsquo;t be impacted by all modules to
load config files, lazy loading is encouraged unless the module must be
initialized during server start up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;loading-sequence&#34;&gt;Loading sequence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each module should have a config file that named the same as the module name.
For example, Security module as a config file named security.json and it is
reside in the module /src/main/resources/config folder by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For application that uses Security module, it can override the default module
level config by provide security.json in application&amp;rsquo;s resource
folder /src/main/resources/config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Config will also be loaded from class path of the application and this is
mainly used for testing as it is easy to inject different combination of
config copies in test cases into class path for unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For official runtime environment, config files should be externalized to a
separate folder outside of the package by a system property
&amp;ldquo;light-java-config-dir&amp;rdquo;. You can start the server with
a &amp;ldquo;-Dlight-java-config-dir=/config&amp;rdquo; option and put all your files
into /config. Once in docker image, it can be mapped to a host volume
with -v /etc/undertow:/config in docker run command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given above explanation, the loading sequence is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System property &amp;ldquo;light-java-config-dir&amp;rdquo; specified directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class Path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application resources/config folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module resources/config folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load config into static variable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;static final Map&amp;lt;String, Object&amp;gt; config = Config.getInstance().getJsonMapConfig(JwtHelper.SECURITY_CONFIG);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load config when it is used&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ValidatorConfig config = (ValidatorConfig)Config.getInstance().getJsonObjectConfig(CONFIG_NAME, ValidatorConfig.class);

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
