      <description>For some of the APIs/services, the endpoints will be accessed from a Single Page Application(React/Vue/Angular) served from another domain. In this case, the API server needs to handle the pre-flight OPTIONS request to enable CORS.
As CORS only used in above scenario, the handler is not wired in by default in swagger-codegen.
If you want to limit only several domains for CORS, you also need to create cors.yml in config folder.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is a tutorial to show you how to use service registry and discovery for microservices. We are going to use api_a, api_b, api_c and api_d as our examples. To simply the tutorial, I am going to disable the security all the time.
The specifications for above APIs can be found at https://github.com/networknt/swagger
Preparation In order to follow the steps below, please make sure you have the same working environment.</description>

      <guid>https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/tutorials/database/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Most microservices will have to access database in order to fulfill consumer requests. In this tutorial, we will walk through the following steps with Oracle/Postgres/Mysql for light-rest-4j framework. If you use light-graphql-4j or light-hybrid-4j the steps will be somewhat different but the concept is the same.
 How to setup database connection pool How to connect to the database instance How to do query database tables How to update database tables  Preparation In order to follow the steps below, please make sure you have the same working environment.</description>

      <description>As there is no container in Undertow Server and everything is built on top of POJO, it is very easy to debug your API application within your IDE.
I am using Intellij Idea but Eclipse should be very similar as the generated project is standard Maven project. To debug your code, you need to start the server.
Here is the steps to create a standalone application in Idea.
 Click Run and select Edit Configurations&amp;hellip; Click + on the top left corner to add a new Configuration.</description>

      <title>Chain Pattern Microservices</title>

      <description>Introduction These days light weight container like Docker is getting traction, more and more API services are developed for docker container and deployed to the cloud. In this environment, traditional heavy weight containers like Java EE and Spring are losing ground as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to have a heavy weight container wrapped with a light weight docker container. Docker and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are replacing all the functionalities Java EE provides without hogging resources.</description>
